# Math Object Utility
Classes to model mathematical objects in 3D space like points, vectors, planes, etc.

## Objective:
To generate a set of classes that can be used as the basis for equations. This involves matrices, vectors, numbers, and variables. These will be used to create solvable equations that can be mathematically manipulated with the usual methods.

These classes can model these mathematical objets but aren't bound together by a central program

## Classes:

- Matrix
- Vector
- Plane
- Point
